Indentation:
	- 4 Spaces = 1 Tab
	- Indent one tab for each level of brackets surround the code
	eg:
	Class Robot {
		void someFunction(void) {
			print("hi");
		}
	}

Functions:
	- Functions that are supposed to be empty should have a "return;" so it is clear that no code is missing
	- The open bracket "{" goes on the same line as the function declaration, the closing bracket "}" goes on the line following the last line of code
	- One space between the end of the function declaration and the "{"
	- Function names should be in CamelCase (first letter of each word capitalized)
	- There should be one line between the "}" of the old function and the function declaration of the next function
	void UselessFunction(void) {
		return;
	}
Comments:
	- Comments that are more than one line should have their own line and come before the lines of code they are commenting on
	- Comments that are only one line share a line with the first line of the code they comment on
Objects:
	- When a class represents a singular physical object, give it the same name as the original class in all lowercase,
		seperated by underscores eg "DriveTrain* drivetrain"
	- Use pointers!
	- When there will be multiple instances of the same class (eg joysticks and motors) name them clearly, in all lowercase, with underscores seperating words
		eg "front_right_motor" "joystick_1"
